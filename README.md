### Problem Statement:

Giant Tiger is planning to open a new store in Essex and seeks to determine the most optimal location for profitability and operational efficiency. The problem is to identify a location that ensures:

1. **Optimal Customer Base**: A sufficient population within a 10km radius that guarantees the store will be financially viable, targeting a population of at least 15,000 people.
   
2. **Negligible Cannibalization Risk**: The proximity to existing stores should be assessed to avoid sales cannibalization, ensuring that a new store does not significantly impact the performance of nearby stores.

3. **Supply Chain and Stocking Efficiency**: The location should allow for smooth supply chain operations and cost-effective stocking procedures, benefiting from the proximity to existing stores and the centralization of distribution.

4. **Right Target Audience**: The store should cater to the right target demographic, with median income levels that align with Giant Tiger’s value-focused customer base.

5. **Real Estate Affordability**: The store's location should offer favorable real estate costs, ensuring that the leasing or operating expenses are not prohibitively high, which is essential for maintaining profitability.

### Technology Used: Maptitude

**Maptitude** was used to analyze geographic and demographic data to select the most optimal location for the new Giant Tiger store. The tool provided:

- **Population Analysis**: Maptitude helped identify the population within a 10km radius, confirming that Essex has a population of 17,018, which supports the financial viability requirement.

- **Cannibalization Assessment**: Maptitude’s mapping features allowed us to evaluate the distance between the new store and existing stores, ensuring that the risk of cannibalizing sales from nearby locations like Windsor is negligible.

- **Supply Chain Optimization**: The tool assisted in identifying the geographical proximity to existing stores for efficient logistics management, helping ensure smooth operations and stocking procedures.

- **Demographic Profiling**: Maptitude’s demographic mapping helped confirm that Essex has the right target audience, with an average household income of CAD 83,000, aligning with Giant Tiger’s customer base.

- **Cost Analysis**: Maptitude helped assess the real estate landscape, supporting the decision to choose Essex for its favorable operating and leasing costs. 

Through the use of **Maptitude**, we were able to make data-driven decisions for the optimal store location based on the combination of population size, supply chain logistics, competition, and real estate costs.
